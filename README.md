As food prices have risen due to factors such as inflation, I worked with members of the NewsHour digital and product team to design, prototype and develop an interactive web page where users can watch and read to learn how to best shop on a budget, then take our quiz to test their skills.

It was also featured on our [broadcast program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emErLPu0-O0&t=12s).
