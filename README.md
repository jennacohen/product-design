Printing Hate is an investigation into how white-owned newspapers have aided and abetted lynchings since 1865.

Our design also included several story page layouts and an interactive database.

### [Quiz: Are You A Smart Shopper?](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/smart-shopping-quiz/)

As food prices have risen due to factors such as inflation, I worked with members of the NewsHour digital and product team to design and develop an interactive web page where users can watch and read to learn how to best shop on a budget, then take our quiz to test their skills. The interactive led our site for engagement time on a single page during the week following publication. It was also featured on our [broadcast program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emErLPu0-O0&t=12s).

**My role:**

- Data reporting and analysis: Google Sheets
